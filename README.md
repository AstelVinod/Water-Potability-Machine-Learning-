This repository hosts a data science project dedicated to addressing the critical public health challenge of water safety by leveraging machine learning.The core objective is to develop a robust, 
data-driven classifier capable of instantly predicting whether a water sample is potable (safe for consumption) ornon-potable based on key physicochemical properties. The model utilizes a dataset 
comprising nine essential water quality parameters (pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic-Carbon, Trihalomethanes, and Turbidity).Through rigorous Comparative Analysis of 
multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest), the Random Forest Classifier was identified as the optimal model, achieving a top accuracy.
The project highlights that ensemble methods are necessary to capture the complex, non-linear interactions among water quality features that define potability, moving beyond simple regulatory threshold checks.
The ultimate goal is to provide a fast, cost-effective tool that can augment traditional laboratory testing, enabling near real-time monitoring and minimizing the public health risk associated with contaminated drinking water sources.
